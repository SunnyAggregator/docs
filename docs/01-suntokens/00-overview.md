## sunTokens are tokenized veTokens

sunTokens, or sunTOK for short, are liquid staking governance tokens backed 1:1 by [Tribeca voting escrow tokens (veTokens)](https://docs.tribeca.so/electorate/voting-escrow#voting-escrow-tokens).

- If a user deposits **SBR** into Sunny, that **SBR** is locked forever on the platform as **veSBR**.
- A tokenized version of **veSBR**, **sunSBR**, is returned to the user at a 1:1 rate.

## sunSBR Staking

- **sunSBR** can be staked into the platform to receive normal Saber admin fees one would get for staking their **veSBR** on [Tribeca](https://tribeca.so/gov/sbr).
- Additionally, users staking **sunSBR** will receive **SBR** from Sunny's performance fee, as well as the platform native token **SUNNY**.
